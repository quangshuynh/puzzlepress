"""Studio adapter for the Planning workspace: status, draft checks, saves and approval.

Every decision is made by `puzzlepress.planning`, exactly as for `puzzlepress
plan`; this module locates the project's planning.yaml, maps expected failures
to HTTP errors and presents reports. The plan has its own byte revision, so a
planning save never changes book.yaml and never conflicts with a book draft.
Approval records the planning identity of the saved plan the author reviewed.
