"""Review identities: exactly what an author's confirmation was given for.

A confirmation in `publishing.attestations` stores the review identity of the
content the author reviewed. It applies only while that identity equals the
identity of the current content: editing reviewed content makes it stale, and
restoring exactly the reviewed content makes it apply again (identity, not time).
Each confirmation covers only what its statement is about, so an unrelated edit
leaves it in place. Identities are SHA-256 over canonical JSON of values: no
paths, times, display labels or file names (the photograph counts by its pinned
SHA-256). Python computes them; a digest identifies content and proves nothing
about authorship, rights or ownership.
